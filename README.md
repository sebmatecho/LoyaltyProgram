# Loyalty Program Technical Assesment.

In this repository, a solution for a technical assesment used by a Colombian bank hiring Data Scientist is proposed. 

## The presented scenario

In such bank, a loyalty program is held once a year. When selected, the client receives a formal invitation containing the details of the package and some benefits are offered. The bank would like to be very effective when selecting the clients to make the offer (this is, the highest the percentage of acceptance of the program, the better) and, thus, is relying on information gathered on a past campaing. The dataset provided contains financial information of clients (anonymous information). We are tasked to build a model able to provide a list of potential clients to send the offer.
